    <p>Vintage 1960s Singer sewing machine in good working condition. This is a Model 403A, considered one of the best vintage machines for its durability and versatility. It's been serviced recently and runs smoothly.</p>
    
    <p>The machine comes in its original mid-century cabinet, which folds down into a neat table when not in use. Includes original manual, several presser feet, bobbins, and accessories. The cabinet has some wear consistent with age but is solid and functional.</p>
    
    <p>This is an all-metal machine built to last generations - they don't make them like this anymore! It handles everything from delicate fabrics to denim with ease. Asking $175. Local pickup only from Ridgewood (near Myrtle-Wyckoff).</p>

    <h2>Madison Park winter coat giveaway</h2>
    <div class="post-date">January 18, 2025</div>
    
    <p>Ridgewood Mutual Aid is organizing our annual winter coat giveaway at Madison Park. We have collected over 200 coats in various sizes for adults and children that will be distributed to community members in need.</p>
    
    <p>The giveaway will take place from 11am to 3pm, or until supplies last. No documentation or proof of need is required - this event operates on a solidarity model rather than a charity model.</p>
    
    <p>If you have coats to donate, you can bring them to the event or drop them off at Tiny Arts Supply during business hours before January 16th.</p>
